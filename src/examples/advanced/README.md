Async App - Advanced example
============================

This example is an in-memory TODO app that showcases most of the good stuff in
`async-app`, including:
  - documentation
  - success status
  - schema validation
  - middleware ordering
  - error handling
  - testing
  - TypeScript

Do note that this example uses two additional MURAL packages:
  - [mural-schema](https://github.com/muralco/mural-schema) For schema
    validation
  - [pickled-cucumber](https://github.com/muralco/pickled-cucumber) For API
    integration tests
